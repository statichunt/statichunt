Like shadcn, but purely Astro components with vanilla Javascript / Typescript. Own the code with an easy-to-use CLI to add component code directly to your projects, where you have full control over all behavior and styling. Designed to be accessible and fully keyboard navigatable. Open source and MIT licensed.
