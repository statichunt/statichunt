Bulma is a free, open-source CSS framework based on Flexbox. It was designed to be simple and easy to use, and it allows developers to create responsive, mobile-first layouts with minimal effort. Bulma Templates are pre-designed layouts and page designs built using the Bulma framework. They can be used as a starting point for building web applications or websites, and can save developers time by providing a basic layout and design that can be customized to fit the needs of the project.
